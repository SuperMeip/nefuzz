Adding calendar events:

	Try not to include the state in the event name, this makes it redundant in the tweet
	
	If any recurring events need to be changed tell me it may mess stuff up, I'm not sure
	
	To add a recurring event it must be incredibly conistant, like the Coffee meet or the CT Diner meet
	
	For the 'RI Furbowl' type it just like that, no numbers following
	
	If a twitter is avaialble always use twitter as a contact
		Special cases, always use these for their events:
			@microfurcon
			@nhfurbowl
			@massfurbowl
		Don't forget to use state twitters if the state group is hosting it:
			@nhfurs
			@rifurs (use this for anything hosted by cirus too)
			@mafurs
			@mainefurs (anything hosted by nova too)
			@vermontfurs
			@ctfurs
		if they don't have a twitter, get their FA name followed by [FA]
		
	Format for event details:
		LINK
		CONTACT
		NOTES (if it a con, make the note 'CON!')
