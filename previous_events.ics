DESCRIPTION:https://www.facebook.com/events/1808809359350205/\n\nAfter a b
 reak in May the central mass bowl is back!\n\nRemember\, it's been moved t
 o a new venue! The new venue is the Mohegan Bowl at 51 Thompson Road in We
 bster Mass. This location is candlepin (aka small balls). The Bowl will be
  Friday\, June 17 from 6-9 PM.\n\n$10 to bowl\, which includes shoes\, for
  3 hours of unlimited bowling (that's like $3\, a game \;p). $5 cover char
 ge if you're not bowling. No feetpaws on lanes! The owner doesn't want us 
 falling (and suing). If you bowl\, make sure you get shoes. Your bowling c
 ost includes the shoes\, just go to the counter and say you're with the gr
 oup.\n\nNow...the best part about this: we have a MASSIVE area to use as a
  headless lounge. There's a restaurant/bar attached to the alley that hasn
 't been used in some time. The owner has agreed to let us use that as our 
 headless lounge and he will put down tables and chairs for people to use f
 or games and hanging out\, to keep foot traffic by the lanes clear. We'll 
 have access to five lanes closest to this area\, and there are bathrooms d
 irectly next to the bar as well. All he asks is if you use the space to ha
 ng out you get a snack and drink. They have everything from chicken finger
 s and fries\, popcorn\, pizza\, pretzels\, slushies\, soda\, and a variety
  of brews on tap. I'm thrilled we get to have such a large space for hangi
 ng out so I ask you please be courteous and clean up after yourselves in t
 here (no fur tumbleweeds n stuff). There's also a large game room (a la th
 e Cape Bowl's) with redemption area.\n\nWhen you arrive remember to find m
 e to check in and pay\, and fill out our log book. I'll be wearing my Nish
 a tail so I should be easy to spot.\n\nAfter the bowl there's a number of 
 food options in the area\, a number of them fast food. Last bowl two group
 s went out\, one to Mexicali grill and the other to Wind Tiki for Chinese.
  Both are very good and decently priced. I haven't decided which will be t
 he "official" spot post bowl\, but if a group is planning to go calling ah
 ead is reccommended.\n\nThis is a very popular site for families\, so be r
 espectful and watch your boundaries. If you are suiting\, let them approac
 h you to interact. Don't go hounding them (no pun intended\, honest!). The
  manager and staff loved us last time\, let's keep our new home!\n\n\nIf I
 've missed anything please tell me! Hope to see you there!

 be our 4th year doing this walk....every year the group has been getting b
 igger and bigger and every year they always love having us there :) Let's 
 make this the biggest year so far! This is the annual spring Autism Speaks
  U walk at Uconn in Storrs CT.....fullsuits and partials are welcome....if
  you would like to be a handler that is also welcome. This is an outdoor e
 vent so be sure to hydrate yourself before\, during\, and after the walk. 
 The handlers will be asked to carry water for the suiters. In recent years
  we have been asked to kick off the race....before the race starts we will
  line each side of the raceway and greet the runners and walkers with chee
 rs\, howls\, and high fives! We will then (depending on the weather and te
 mps) decide to either walk the 3K route through the center of town or cut 
 through the center of campus. If you do so choose to either take the 3K ro
 ute or 5K route...please do so at your own risk and please please please d
 o NOT go off on your own. Be sure you have someone with you at all times..
 .the last thing I want to see or need to see is a suiter collapse or faint
  when nobody is around. I strive to keep everyone safe at all of my events
 .\n\nTo join the team you will need to make at least a 25$ donation...but 
 you may feel free to donate more than tha if you so choose to. You mat als
 o create your own page and get friends and family members to either donate
  to the team page or your own specific page. All money donated will go to 
 Autism Speaks through Uconn. You can also sign up on race day...the cost w
 ill then be 30$ but again you are more than welcome to donate more than th
 at.\n\nWe will meet up at Uconn between 10am and 10:30 am across from Gamp
 el Pavillion where the starting line and finish line is. There is a small 
 parking garage around the corner behind the student center where for a sma
 ll fee you can park. There is no changing rooms provided so arriving in yo
 ur gear and suiting up in the parking garage would be ideal. There are bat
 hrooms inside the student center if need be. \n\nWe will then head down to
  the starting area and be mascots....entertain the crowd and kids. There w
 ill be music\, activities\, and other stuff. Please be aware of your surro
 undings\, and please be on your best behavior. The 5K race will start prec
 isely at 12pm sharp\, shortly followed by the 3K walk. After the race conc
 ludes\, there will be live music\, water\, and free food for everyone whic
 h is usually pizza or something.\n\nWe will then gather for a group photo 
 across the street by the Uconn huksy statue by Gampel Pavillion.....in bet
 ween all of the other group photos we usually are asked to take lol.\n\nAf
 ter all of that.....if you may choose to\, you can desuit at your car or i
 f you feel comfortable staying in suit you may do so also. We will be head
 ing into the student center foof court where there is a dunkin donuts\, we
 ndys\, subway\, and other food options. How long you want to stay is entir
 ely up to you.\n\nAttire.....please be curteous when wearing harnesses and
  collars.....no muzzle harnesses and leashes. Body harnesses are okay.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:https://www.facebook.com/events/1180482865312653/\n\nHello all
 !\n\nI will be hosting an Oriental Themed Pot Luck in January the 16th\, 2
 pm to 9pm. Everyone will be required to RSVP for this event and are requir
 ed to bring a dish or tea.\n\nIf you are bringing a dish\, keep in mind po
 tential food allergies and please keep a list of ingredients around to hav
 e with your dish. There are several ingredients in many Asian dishes that 
 could trigger someone's food allergies so keep that in mind. Not saying do
 n't make em though cause I have no food allergies haha.\n\nIf you have a f
 ood allergy\, please let me know.\n\nAlso\, I will be providing paper plat
 es and utensils. If you need more (bowls for soups\, curry\, etc) let me k
 now or try to bring them.\n\nRemember\, there are rules you must follow wh
 en attending my meets\, especially those in my place. \n\nFirst and Foremo
 st\, no uninvited physical contact and strictly nothing sexual in any natu
 re what so ever. This is my condo\, not yours. Please respect everyone\, n
 o smoking inside my place (those you may Vape in my bedroom). If you wish 
 to smoke\, I will show you where you can and you can not toss your cigaret
 tes on the ground. Also no drug or alcohol use.\n\n**LOCATION IS AT THE AD
 DRESS LISTED ABOVE. CONFIRMED.**\n\n-- I may be holding my mother's house 
 since it is bigger but people are welcome to spend the night back at my pl
 ace after.--\n\n**at my place\n\nParking spots are assigned! However in th
 e back left corner is a good sized lot for guest parking. \n\nTry not to b
 e talking or loud when coming up and down the stairs. Be respectful of my 
 neighbors.\n\nNo lewd conduct in the parking lot. Also\, please do not arr
 ive dragging someone else on a leash. This happened last time and it made 
 people feel uncomfortable. Keep your fetishes to your bedrooms\, not mine\
 , but wearing dog collars are fine. Also\, some people have chilled at my 
 place in fursuits\, that is fine. I don't have the most space but it's coo
 l.\n\n**at my mother's\n\nThere is street side parking. The neighbor is of
 f the main road so it is kinda private. She is used to hosting parties wit
 h many people so this is nothing new to her. \n\nSmoking is allowed in the
  house as she is a smoker\, however I would like it if you only smoked on 
 the porch or bar room. \n\nFursuits and the like are allowed. My mother ha
 s one dog\, small\, derpy\, and adorable. \n\nAll the same physical contac
 t and such rules apply at my mother's just like at my place. If you need t
 o spend the night you are welcome to come back to my place after to crash 
 the night.\n\nOnly extra rules here is that we are required to clean up al
 l of our mess before leaving :3\n\nOther than that\, have fun\, try not to
  be too loud haha

  for filling out the survey it is very apprecaited. \nDecember is a crazy 
 month Christmas is just around the corner so we'll be having a social dinn
 er this weekend. It was tough to decide a place based on all the responses
  I recieved so I picked Habachi Grill and Buffet. Chinese and Japanese was
  a popular choice among you furs\, but it should have some American food t
 oo. :3 \nPrice: The buffet dinner price is 15$ per person (it's 11.99 but 
 please consider taxes) \nIt will take place at 7 pm\, giving people time t
 o get off work or finish thier day to day activites. If you are interested
  in going and may come late please do not worry my cellphone number is 401
  316 3987. \n\nIf there's enough interest among members\, a meet in warwic
 k mall prior to the dinner event is possible\, please remember it is Star 
 Wars weekend so movie theathers will be packed! If it snows then an organi
 zed snowball fight will occur for those wanting it at a local park. Please
  stay tune for more updates. If you have any questions or concerns post be
 low.\n\nIf you need a ride please contact me. There's a 3$ gas fee and I w
 ork overnight that night so I will be returning people home early before g
 oing to work. Please feel free to message me for more information\n\nThank
  you and hope to see you there!

  crowdsource a bit here.\n\nI will be planning an event at the Dave and Bu
 ster's in Manchester CT.\n\nIn order to get a reservation for 10-20 people
 \, there is a revenue minimum that we must meet. It is $500 on food\, drin
 ks\, and Power Cards. That means if 20 people show up\, it's only $25 per 
 person (which can be easily spent on food\, drinks\, games) We get the tab
 le for 2 hours and there will be a contract (which I will have to sign\, a
 nd I don't want to foot the bill if we don't spend $500 which is why it's 
 important that we do)\nThe less people show up\, the more it will cost per
  person.\n\nIf MORE than 20 people are interested\, we can upsize to a hal
 f room OR full room. These would require is to get our own buffet\, which 
 will cost per person. (Minimum $27 per person but includes food\, unlimite
 d soda/coffee/tea and a $10 game card) They are rented out for 3 hours at 
 a time.\n\nHalf room can fit 15 to 36 people. The room itself costs $150 b
 ut it goes towards the revenue minimum which is $1100.\n\nFull room can fi
 t up to 80 people. The room itself costs $300 but it goes towards the reve
 nue minimum which is $2000.\n\nAttire for dining room will most likely be 
 tails/ears\, preferably NOT full suits. This is because there will be a lo
 t of normies and their children\, and the last thing we want is people sto
 pping us every 5 seconds thinking we are a mascot or something and taking 
 pictures with us. If you guys really want to wear your fullsuits to this\,
  we should book one of the private rooms.\n\nThis is all very confusing bu
 t the more people I can get to go\, the less it will cost for each person.
  The more people show up\, the better our party can be.\n\nTHIS EVENT PAGE
  IS ONLY TO SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED\, THEN I WILL SEE ABOUT BOO
 KING AND SIGNING THE CONTRACT. PLEASE RSVP TO THIS EVENT IF YOU CAN DEFINI
 TELY MAKE IT. \n\nPlease message me if you have questions or would like to
  help me plan this event!

DESCRIPTION:https://www.facebook.com/events/808690962577101/\n\nAs we did 
 last year\, there will be an outdoor furmeet at a corn maze! The location 
 is Escobar's Highland Farm in Portsmouth. This will be held on Saturday\, 
 October 24 at 12 noon. The address is 255 Middle Road in Portsmouth.\n\nAd
 mission is $8 for ages 12 and up. You can print a $1 coupon at this link: 
 http://www.escobarshighlandfarm.com/coupon.html They are having a Hallowee
 n costume party that day\, so you can get $1 off admission if you come in 
 a costume.\n\nFursuits are allowed! This is an outdoor event\, so we will 
 not have a designated space to take a break and change up\, so we'll have 
 to head back to our cars. Be aware of your limits while fursuiting. Anyone
  who is not fursuiting will be a handler. We shall do one side of the maze
 \, take a break\, and then do the other half.\n\nThe maze's theme this yea
 r is the Pawtucket Red Sox. Bring anything baseball related if you can. Th
 ere are also concessions\, hayrides and games at the farm.\n\nRemember tha
 t this is a public event with families and children present. Be on your be
 st behavior at all times. You are representing the Furry Fandom while you 
 are there.\n\nPlease reply so we'll know how many people are coming.

 m. They feature 18 holes of indoor miniature golf under blacklights with a
  ghoulish monster theme. The address is 140 Taunton Ave\, Seekonk\, MA. (M
 AP IS HERE) It is behind the Price-Rite supermarket.\n\nAdmission is $10. 
 No exceptions. If you are coming\, you are paying $10 even if you don't go
 lf. This is to help offset the cost of renting a party room. IMPORTANT: A 
 HEAD COUNT IS NEEDED by Tuesday\, October 6\, so please let me know if you
  are coming. The deposit on the party room is non-refundable.\n\nThe party
  room will be our fursuit changing area and it may be crowded in there. If
  you have any problems with this as far as changing up or if you want a pr
 ivate space\, please let me know ASAP.\n\nI would suggest that you arrive 
 on time and change up into fursuit as soon as possible. The room is reserv
 ed for two hours\, and it takes a while to get a large group to go through
  18 holes of mini-golf.\n\n\n\n\nJournal by CirrusSkyDragon  CirrusSkyDrag

 e... FIGHT!\n\nThis is the 3rd ever Furcade South Meet @ Tri-State Speedwa
 ys in Dudley MA! This is a "sister meet" to the Furcade North (Pelham)\, a
 nd it is located 20 minutes south of Worcester MA\, right on the Connectic
 ut border.\n\nAt the last Furcade South we had 25+ people and we're excite
 d to see this new event grow. Going forward\, we will alternate month-to-m
 onth between "North" and "South" meets... There is talk of Pinball Wizard 
 moving or renovating in the near future - this may also provide an alterna
 te meet location while they are closed.\n\nTri-State Speedways has dozens 
 of arcade games which operate on tokens and spit out prize tickets\, a lar
 ge indoor Go-Kart race track\, indoor roller skating rink with music and b
 lacklights\, indoor mini-golf course and play structure\, two bowling lane
 s\, and several billiards tables and dart boards. They also have an on-sit
 e restaurant with a full bar\, indoor and outdoor (smoking) seating\, and 
 food of similar style and price to Applebees or The 99.\n\nThe event start
 s at 5pm "furry time" - feel free to show up late\, but PLEASE don't come 
 too early! They won't be ready for us... At 9:15ish the party room and rac
 etrack will close\, and those who want to stay for food (and games) will m
 ove downstairs to the restaurant where there are arcade games\, pool table
 s and dartboards - skating will continue. Don't forget the Auburn Meet & G
 reet @ Rocketland Park leading up to Furcade!\n\nPricing:\n\nGames--------

 LIT BETWEEN MEMBERS!\n\nGoKart riders must wear closed-toe shoes (no sanda
 ls!) and may or may not be able to ride with fursuit heads on\, depending 
 on visibility and staff judgement....\n\nFursuits are not only welcome\, b
 ut encouraged! Like Furcade North (Pelham)\, we've reserved and rented the
  party room at the arcade\, which means tables for card games and food\, a
 nd a place to store fursuit boxes. There are tables for for MTG and Cards 
 Against Humanity\, as well as a table for snacks. Feel free to bring treat
 s to share with your fellow furs! At the last few meets we had lots of tas
 ty baked goods thanks to our guests. There's plenty of parking\, and food 
 on-site.\n\nWe ask that guests each chip $5 at the door to offset the cost
  of renting the place. Why rent out the room? The arcade is a business\, t
 hey're there to make money... We know many if not most attendees will play
  card games and hang out rather than pumping quarters into the machines or
  racing/skating/etc - and that's OK because we own the space for the night
 ! In the event that we exceed the cost of the rental and snacks\, addition
 al funds collected will go towards making the next meet bigger/longer/bett
 er.\n\nAs always\, let's be respectful of other arcade guests\, and repres
 ent the fandom well\, so that we are invited back. No drugs or drama\, ple
 ase! There is alcohol at the bar\, but don't overdo it! Remember we are he
 re to have FUN and all rumors and "beef" should be left at the door - if y
 ou do have an issue or concern\, inform one of the hosts and we will addre
 ss it (don't gossip or post it publicly).\n\n\nRSVP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the

 ... FIGHT!\n\nThis is the 2nd ever Furcade South Meet @ Tri-State Speedway
 s in Dudley MA! This is a "sister meet" to the Furcade North (Pelham)\, an
 d it is located 20 minutes south of Worcester MA\, right on the Connecticu
 t border.\n\nAt the last Furcade South we had 25+ people and we're excited
  to see this new event grow. Going forward\, we will alternate month-to-mo
 nth between "North" and "South" meets... There is talk of Pinball Wizard m
 oving or renovating in the near future - this may also provide an alternat
 e meet location while they are closed.\n\nTri-State Speedways has dozens o
 f arcade games which operate on tokens and spit out prize tickets\, a larg
 e indoor Go-Kart race track\, indoor roller skating rink with music and bl
 acklights\, indoor mini-golf course and play structure\, two bowling lanes
 \, and several billiards tables and dart boards. They also have an on-site
  restaurant with a full bar\, indoor and outdoor (smoking) seating\, and f
 ood of similar style and price to Applebees or The 99.\n\nThe event starts
  at 5pm "furry time" - feel free to show up late\, but PLEASE don't come t
 oo early! They won't be ready for us... At 9:15ish the party room and race
 track will close\, and those who want to stay for food (and games) will mo
 ve downstairs to the restaurant where there are arcade games\, pool tables
  and dartboards - skating will continue.\n\nPricing:\n\nGames-------------
 ----------$0.25 Tokens (varies)\nPlayplace--------------------$5 "Play All
  Day"\nMiniGolf----------------------$5 "Play All Day"\nBumper Cars-------
 --------$3 (Per Ride)\nCandlepin Bowling---------$2 (10 Frames)\nRoller Sk
 ating---------------$10 (Rental + Admission)\n$7 if you have your own!\n"U
 nlimited Wristband"----$15 (Bumper Cars\, Playplace\, Minigolf)\n\nGoKarts
  (Non-member)-----$15/race\n\nGoKart Membership----------$10/year\n\nGoKar
 t Member Prices:\n$12 - 1 Race\n$30 - 3 Races\n$55 - 5 Races\n$100 - 10 Ra
 ces\n\nRACE PACKAGES CAN BE SHARED / SPLIT BETWEEN MEMBERS!\n\nGoKart ride
 rs must wear closed-toe shoes (no sandals!) and may or may not be able to 
 ride with fursuit heads on\, depending on visibility and staff judgement..
 ..\n\nFursuits are not only welcome\, but encouraged! Like Furcade North (
 Pelham)\, we've reserved and rented the party room at the arcade\, which m
 eans tables for card games and food\, and a place to store fursuit boxes. 
 There are tables for for MTG and Cards Against Humanity\, as well as a tab
 le for snacks. Feel free to bring treats to share with your fellow furs! A
 t the last few meets we had lots of tasty baked goods thanks to our guests
 . There's plenty of parking\, and food on-site.\n\nWe ask that guests each
  chip $5 at the door to offset the cost of renting the place. Why rent out
  the room? The arcade is a business\, they're there to make money... We kn
 ow many if not most attendees will play card games and hang out rather tha
 n pumping quarters into the machines or racing/skating/etc - and that's OK
  because we own the space for the night! In the event that we exceed the c
 ost of the rental and snacks\, additional funds collected will go towards 
 making the next meet bigger/longer/better.\n\nAs always\, let's be respect
 ful of other arcade guests\, and represent the fandom well\, so that we ar
 e invited back. No drugs or drama\, please! There is alcohol at the bar\, 
 but don't overdo it! Remember we are here to have FUN and all rumors and "
 beef" should be left at the door - if you do have an issue or concern\, in
 form one of the hosts and we will address it (don't gossip or post it publ
 icly).\n\n\nRSVP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the TL\;DR Crowd...\n\n-Arcade Meet Se
 ptember 26th @ 5PM\n-Suits\, ears & tails welcome\n-Feel free to bring sna
 cks/treats to share\n-Tables for MTG & CAH\n-$5 cover charge\n-Don't be a

 l the summer and Wednesday looks like its going to have some decent summer
  weather. So why not have fun at an amusement park :3!\n\nCanobie Lake Par
 k will be open from 11 am to 10 pm. Parking is free\, but its $36 to get i
 n to the park or &25 for everyone after 5pm. Check the official site here 
 : http://www.canobie.com/index.html for more information! Please do not tr
 y to bring outside food into the park\, as you enter through the second ga
 te the employees will mark your hand with a stamp so you can come and go a
 s you please! I would suggest eating lunch/dinner at your car as it saves 
 you money from expensive park food :3 Also if you bring a bag there will b
 e people at the second gate who will be there to check bags. If you need t
 o take medications during the day\, there will be a window on your right d
 irectly after passing the second gate\, please check in there! Chances are
  a staff member at the gates will direct you to the window.\n\nThere are l
 ockers at the park\, there are some near the water park and some near the 
 front gate. The price of use will depend which lockers you go to and the s
 ize of the lockers. I will email Canobie asking for details on those.\n\nW
 hether you like roller coasters\, water rides\, or some of the more docile
  rides\, Canobie has a nice mix with 4 roller coasters ranging from docile
  for kids to the extremes of an almost vertical drop! They also have more 
 docile rides like a Ferris Wheel and a pirate ship themed ride that swings
  from side to side. Do you like water? Canobie also has a log flume ride a
 s well as a major flume ride\, don't want to ride the water rides\, but st
 ill want to get splashed? Its okay you can always just get hit by the mass
 ive wave that comes up from the Boston Tea Party or ride down the water sl
 ide on a tube! They also have a whole water park.\nThere are also small at
 tractions like games\, arcades\, a mirror maze and more!\n\nRides may shut
  down do to weather like if a thunder storm occurs. Whether the ride is sh
 ut down for the rest of the day or only temporary that is up to the park!\
 n\nIf anyone goes to Canobie\, stay safe and fun! There is a first aid sta
 tion in the park\, but lets try not to have anyone visit it! It may be a w
 eekday so chances are the park won't be as packed as the weekend\, but ple
 ase be weary of your environment\, including little kids or people running
  through the park!\n\nI will also be emailing Canobie on if they will allo
 w suits or just simply tails.\n\nPlease check the website for Canobie here
  : http://www.canobie.com/index.html for more information on prices for th
 e park\, information on rides\, a map of the park\, and more!\n\nGot quest
 ions? Go ahead and send me a message and I will do my best to answer it! :

 658730597595631/\n\nCome hang with your fellow furs and enjoy a day in the
  surf and sun! Of course\, if the surf and sand aren't your thing there's 
 plenty more to do too!\n\nThe "official" location\, if you put it into you
 r GPS\, will put you in the parking lot behind the former Surf Hotel/ Happ
 y Hampton arcade.\n\nThe meetup time is 11:00 am and we will be meeting at
  the Seashell stage across the street from the Casino Ballroom complex. I 
 will have my badges on me so I will be somewhat easy to spot. From there w
 e can decide what to do next\, and there's literally lots to do. As it's l
 ate August the water temp is roughly 65 degrees\, maybe a bit more\, and i
 t doesn't take long for one's body to adjust to the temperature so if it's
  hot\, jump in!\n\nThe parking lots are cheaper the further away from the 
 boardwalk you are\, but it's also a farther walk\, so if you planned on br
 inging beach gear like umbrellas and stuff you will probably want to park 
 closer\, but get there early as prices can rise as the day goes on. The tw
 o best places to park are the Chat Chew and Play lot (you'll find it if yo
 u use the aforementioned "official" location) and the Casino parking lot b
 ehind the waterslides. I've paid $10 for all day parking at both locations
  around 11 am.\n\nFeel free to bring balls\, Frisbees\, Nerf balls\, anyth
 ing like that to use on the sand. Ideally I'd like to have several blanket
 s out as a sort of "base" but that part we can play by ear if people want 
 to shop\, go to arcades or do anything else.\n\nThere are many places to g
 rab a bite to eat\, we could also wrap it up at one of the nicer sit-down 
 sort of places along the boardwalk. I will put up a poll with some names.\
 n\nLet's hope for some nice weather!

DESCRIPTION:Greetings\, Furries and Therians. During a discussion on what 
 else we can do in place of bowls someone said hiking. I immediately though
 t of this place.\n\nThe Mt. Tom state res is a really great place to hike\
 , have a cookout\, bike\, or play sports. \n\nMeeting place: We will be me
 eting by the playground. It is up the hill past the dam. There's a small p
 arking area. If said parking area is full you may need to turn around and 
 park your car in the main parking area that is pretty obvious on your way 
 in. Look for a Silver Mazda 3i that says "Furry Pride" on the rear windshi
 eld. Ill be under a canopy with picnic tables underneath. \n\nThere is a f
 ee to get into the reservation. Please be aware of that. Bring up to $10 b
 ecause I'm not sure what the fee is for a day pass right now.\n\nRules:\n1
 . DO NOT LITTER! I cannot stress that enough. Mt. Tom is beautiful. Let's 
 keep it that way.\n\n2. Fursuiting is not recommended. Itll be the middle 
 of July and it can get hot. Besides\, would we really want to catch the pa
 rk rangers attention?\n\n3. Safety first: I cannot be responsible for anyo
 ne's safety. Mt. Tom is a big place so try to stick to trails. If you are 
 under the age of 18 get parents/guardians permission to go and make sure t
 hey're 100% aware of where/what you are doing. Respect boundaries! \n\nI r
 ecommend you bring plenty of water and OFF! spray. Itll be hot and the bug
 s like to bite around there. \n\n\nIf any admins or experienced event orga
 nizers feel like I'm missing something please let me know.
